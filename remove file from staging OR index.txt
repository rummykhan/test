e.g. you edited a file x.txt


$ git status
# show status that a file x.txt has been edited


$ git add x.txt
#file is added to staging..


now before final commit.. you want to re edit that file and remove from staging area..

$ git reset head x.txt
#file is removed from stages..

Now do whatever you want to do..

$ git add x.txt
#file is added for staging..


$ git commit -m "write commit"
# saved to local repository..


$ git push
# push changed to remote repository..
